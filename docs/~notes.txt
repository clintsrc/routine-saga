
Server Environment Notes
WGSI:
   Similar to the Node.js the core HTTP server module. Django automatically includes it during the initial project configuration.
App server:
   * runserver: a local dev server built into Django (similar to React)
   * gunicorn: a production server package similar to Node.js. It runs the code and manages worker processes in production. Adding gunicorn to WSGI makes it production ready.
      It can be used in a local dev stack in docker, but you'd want to enable hot-reloading (command: gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application --reload --bind 0.0.0.0:8000)
SQL server:
   * SQLite: local dev server, not producton-grade, automatically installed by Django
   * PostgreSQL: typically used in the production environment. It may also be used in the local dev environment instead of SQLite

Requirements
Typically you'll want to manage multiple requirements.txt files:
requirements.txt: the base app requirements
requirements_dev.txt: additional dev tools (e.g. pettier, lint)
requirements_prod.txt: production tools (e.g. gunicorn, psycopg2)

Configuring gunicorn:
NOTE: no code change is required because gunicorn communicates through the WSGI that Django provides
NOTE: fcntl is required for gunicorn but it is not supported for Windows/Cygwin
1. Create a <proj_root>/requirements_prod.txt:
# Requirements for production environment
gunicorn
1. Install it in a fresh venv:
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements_prod.txt
1. You can try running it locally *on nonwindows hosts*:
$ gunicorn core.wsgi:application --bind 127.0.0.1:8000
1. Update the hosting service:
Start: gunicorn core.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT


Configuring PostgreSQL:
- Development:
1. pip install psycopg2-binary  # precompiled binary for the os
2. .env
DB_NAME='bookshelter_db'
DB_USER='postgres'
DB_PASSWORD='insecure'
3. core/settings.py
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": DB_NAME,
        "USER": DB_USER,
        "PASSWORD": DB_PASSWORD,
        "HOST": DB_HOST,
        "PORT": DB_PORT,
    }
}
4. psql -U postgres -f db/schema.sql
5. python manage.py migrate
6. python manage.py runserver

- Prod:
1. Create database using External URL:
Connect to default db then create the new one
psql "postgresql://bookshelter_user:PWxxxxxxxxxxxxx@dpg-d0vo9kfdiees73f2lgig-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/bookshelter_db" -c "CREATE DATABASE routinesaga_db;"
2. Update <proj_root>/requirements_prod.txt:
# Requirements for production environment
gunicorn
psycopg2
3. Set the production Environment variables:
DB_NAME='routinesaga_db'
DB_USER='<user>'
DB_PASSWORD='<password>'

Misc/TODO:
Run runserver locally but configured for my local pgsql (via psycopg2)
Perhaps later on implement a dockerized dev environment that does the same
Production: gunicorn (instead of runserver), and pgsql (psycopg2)
